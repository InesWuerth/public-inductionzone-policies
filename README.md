Contact us at induction.zone@enviconnect.de.

## Applicability
This policy applies to people using our digital infrastructure, including:

- slack channel (inductionzone.slack.com)
- messaging or contact by email, through LinkedIn, or other third-party messaging services.

## Scope of the Induction Zone
The Induction Zone supports individuals, startups, and established companies to find, develop, and deploy technologies to support the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources, particularly wind energy.

## Code of Conduct
The Induction Zone is intended to be a place for people to exchange news, views, ideas, and experience and appear authentically (i.e., speak in a way that is aligned with their own beliefs and experience and not need to present a facade). We encourage all users of our infrastructure to respect this and support each other.

We will not tolerate discrimination, hate speech, or other behaviour that goes against this

## Diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI)
To the extent allowed by law, we strive to include anyone and everyone regardless of gender, sexual preference, age, national origin, educational background, or other differentiating characteristic.

Please note that only persons aged 18 or over will be given access to the induction zone.

### Reporting discrimination
We encourage anyone who feels that they have been discriminated against during an Induction Zone event, or during their use of induction zone infrastructure, or during any other activity related to the Induction Zone, to contact induction.zone@enviconnect.de with a detailed description of what happened.

### How we will deal with discrimination
If we observe discrimination or have discrimination reported to us, we will take steps to stop that discrimination. This may include, but is not limited to:

- verbal or written warnings
- temporary or permanent removal of access to the infrastructure
- referal to applicable law enforcement.

### If you feel you have been discriminated against by us
Please contact us immediately explaining what has occurred, and we will take steps to prevent this from happening again. This does not affect your rights to a legal process.

## Your intellectual property
Unless otherwise agreed, you retain full ownership of your intellectual property during participation in the Induction Zone. You take full responsibility for your intellectual property and agree to protect it at all times. Although we take steps to manage participation in the Induction Zone events it should be considered a public space, and you are encouraged to treat it accordingly.

## How we use your data

By joining the induction zone slack channel you agree to:

- to have high-level analytics about your use of the slack channel made available to the administrators of the slack channel, who are appointed by the operators. These adminstrators do not have access to private messages. For more details see https://slack.com/help/articles/360047512554-Use-channel-management-tools.

By messaging us through email, LinkedIn or other third-party messaging services you agree to:

- to receive email (including marketing) from the operators to the email address you used to contact us. In the event that you use a direct messaging service (e.g., LinkedIn), we may use email addresses that are publically available in your profile. These emails may be sent through third-party tools.
